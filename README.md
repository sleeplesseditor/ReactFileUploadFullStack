# ReactFileUploadFullStack

A full-stack file upload system built using React and Express, following Manny Codes's [article](https://medium.com/@mannycodes/build-a-react-drag-drop-progress-file-uploader-fb874c515a7).

Files are uploaded into the 'files' folder in the 'upload_api' directory. For the best example of the app running, throttle speeds to 'Slow 3G' using Chrome's Developer Tools.

To get the app running, follow these steps: 

1) npm install
2) cd upload_api && npm install
3) cd .. && cd upload_client && npm install
4) cd .. && npm run dev
